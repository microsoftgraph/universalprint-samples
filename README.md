# universalprint-samples

This repo contains code samples that demonstrate how to build applications that integrate with and extend Universal Print. Each directory contains a different set of samples:

1. **S2S Integration Samples** - Samples that implement custom print logic by extending the print workflow.
2. **Graph Sample** - Sample that uses the [Universal Print Graph APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/universal-print-concept-overview) to list printer shares and print documents.
